        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Vivekananda, original name Narendranath Datta, Datta also spelled Dutt, (born January 12, 1863, Calcutta [now
            Kolkata]—died July 4, 1902, near Calcutta), Hindu spiritual leader and reformer in India who attempted to
            combine Indian spirituality with Western material progress, maintaining that the two supplemented and
            complemented one another. His Absolute was a person's own higher self; to labour for the benefit of humanity
            was the noblest endeavour.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution,
            where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877.In 1879, after his family's return to
            Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance
            examination.He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion,
            history, social science, art and literature. He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the
            Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Narendra was
            trained in Indian classical music, and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised
            activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General
            Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College).</p>

        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>While synthesizing and popularizing various strands of Hindu-thought, most notably classical yoga and
            (Advaita) Vedanta, Vivekananda was influenced by western ideas such as Universalism, via Unitarian
            missionaries who collaborated with the Brahmo Samaj. His initial beliefs were
            shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of idolatry,
            and a "streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic
            reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta"</p>

        <h2>Influence and legacy</h2>
        <p>While National Youth Day in India is observed on his birthday, 12 January, the day he delivered his masterful
            speech at the Parliament of Religions, 11 September 1893, is "World Brotherhood Day". The 150th
            birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated in India and abroad. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and
            Sports in India officially observed 2013 as the occasion in a declaration.</p>

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death), Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and
            meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to
            pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00
            pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:20 p.m. while
            meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood
            vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples believed that the rupture
            was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained
            mahasamādhi. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years. He was cremated on
            a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen
            years earlier</p>
